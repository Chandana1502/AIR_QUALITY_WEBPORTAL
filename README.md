# AIR_QUALITY_WEBPORTAL

STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED TO DEVELOP THE WEB PORTAL

1.Install Flask and any necessary dependencies for your project using a package manager such as pip.
2.Create a Flask app and define a route for the home page. This route should render an HTML template with a form where users can enter the name of the city they want to search for air quality data.
3.Define a route for the search functionality. This route should handle the form submission and retrieve the air quality data for the specified city. 
4.Parse the response from the air quality API and extract the relevant air quality data. 
5.Return the air quality data to the user by rendering an HTML template with the results.
6.Run the Flask app using the command python app.py. You should now be able to access the web portal at http://localhost:5000
